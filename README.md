# SoftEther-VPN-LabActivity

![Politecnico di Torino](resources/General/logo_polito.jpg)

This repository is designed to create a lab activity based on the experimental activity of SoftEtherVPN. It provides hands-on exercises for enhancing the security and observability of SoftEther VPN deployments.

The lab activity is derived from the project defined in the `SoftEther-VPN-Guardian` folder, which integrates automated configuration audits and real-time traffic monitoring tools. This lab focuses on applying those concepts in a structured educational environment.
